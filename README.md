# About-Bustabit-predictor-script-
There's something called as bustabit predictor script on GitHub. I am guessing that  what it does is predicting the crash logs of the Bustabit game. The provider of this script is charging money for this script which makes absolutely no sense. If you can make a significant amount of money with it, why do you need money for? Such a scam.
